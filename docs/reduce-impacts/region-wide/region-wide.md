A third intervention to be implemented in order to decrease the negative impacts that informal electronic waste handling has on human health in developing countries is to create regional-wide systems for the proper handling and disposal of electronic waste. For example, the state of California has already implemented such a system through the creation and enforcement of the Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003. The act enforces an electronic waste recycling fee paid by consumers upon the purchase of various electronic devices to provide funding for an electronic waste handling system (California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, n.d., Key Elements of the Act section, para. 1). It also requires that consumers must be able to retrieve information regarding electronic waste handling from electronics manufacturers (California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, n.d., 2005 section, para. 2). Through the implementation of this act, roughly 2.3 billion pounds of electronic waste in California has been formally recycled from 2005 through September 2018 (California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, 2018, p. 3, Revenue and Payment Status section, para. 3). The amount of electronic waste recycled in the state of California as a result of the creation and enforcement of the Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003 serves to display the effectiveness of the implementation of a regional-wide system for the proper handling and disposal of electronic waste. If developing countries imitated the actions taken by California as a result of the passing of the Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003, they could potentially decrease the amount of electronic waste that is processed informally. As a result, more formal electronic waste handling would take place that poses decreased risks to human health.
