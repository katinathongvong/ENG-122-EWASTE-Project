A second intervention to be implemented in order to decrease the health impacts informal electronic waste handling has in developing countries is to have electronics manufacturers introduce more formal structures that increase consumer accessibility to proper recycling and handling of electronic waste. For example, large electronics manufacturers such as Microsoft, Toshiba, and Apple should begin to offer take-back services for deprecated electronics in developing countries. Already, they offer these services in more developed countries such as the United States in order to properly dispose of and recycle electronic waste (Borthakur, 2016, p. 22, Legislation in India section, para. 1). Take-back programs allow consumers to easily get rid of their old electronic devices by shipping them back to the manufacturer or by taking them to drop off centers owned by the electronics manufacturers as opposed to disposing of their old electronics in landfills or other improper means. Electronics manufacturer Sony, for example, offers a take-back program in the United States. By March 2018, the manufacturer had collected 239 million pounds of electronic waste. Additionally, Sony also offers a website that allows consumers to easily search for take-back recycling centers that are closest to them, increasing the likelihood that old devices will be recycled properly. Consumers also have the option of shipping their old devices back to Sony at no cost, if they live more than 25 miles away from the nearest take-back recycling center (Recycling Activities, 2018, Recycling Website section, para. 1-2). By increasing the ease of access that consumers have to properly dispose of their old electronics in formal facilities (as opposed to simply disposing of them in regular landfills), the amount of electronic waste handled informally will decrease in developing countries. As a result, the risk of human exposure to toxic substances that comprise electronic waste decreases with an increase in the amount of electronic waste handled in formal facilities.
