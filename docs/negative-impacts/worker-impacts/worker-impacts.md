# Impacts on Worker Safety

![](https://countercurrents.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/e-waste1.jpg)

Workers rarely use PPE
{: .fs-3 }

The lack of regulations surrounding informal electronic waste handling can have harmful impacts on human health, especially in regards to worker safety. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which is standard practice in more developed countries, is usually absent during these informal procedures (Seeberger et al., 2016, p. 8, Introduction section, para. 2).  Thus, workers are at a much higher risk of workplace injuries such as cuts from the dismantling of various objects and hearing loss from prolonged exposure to loud noises (Burns et al., 2019, p. 8, Discussion section, para. 6).
