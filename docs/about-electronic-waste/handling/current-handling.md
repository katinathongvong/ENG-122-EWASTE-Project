Informal electronic waste handling. Retrieved from [https://www.freepressjournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wastebiz-dec-15.jpg](https://www.freepressjournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wastebiz-dec-15.jpg)

Much of the electronic waste that is generated in developing countries is handled informally. Thus, there are often little environmental or safety regulations regarding which practices workers choose to utilize. Workers partake in elementary practices to recycle and dispose of electronic waste such as dismantling materials with their bare hands, utilizing acid baths to extract various metals, and burning substances such as wires and plastics without ventilation or environmental controls (Annamalai, 2015, p. 63, Health Hazards section, para. 1-3). The informal and elementary nature of these practices can have detrimental impacts on human health.

With the informal natures of these practices in mind, it is important to note that newly released consumer electronics are experiencing increasingly shorter life spans, leading to an overall increase in electronic waste in developing countries. The increased presence of electronic waste has hazardous impacts on human health. In order to effectively reduce the negative impacts caused by the increased presence of electronic waste in developing countries, governments should mandate the implementation of personal protective equipment programs in workplaces, the creation of take-back programs by electronics manufacturers, and the development of regional-wide systems for the proper handling of electronic waste.
