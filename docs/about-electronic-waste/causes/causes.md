There are various causes that contribute to the rapid growth of electronic waste in developing countries which include a lack of consumer knowledge regarding electronic waste, shortened lifespans of electronics and the exportation of electronic waste from developed countries to developing countries. First, it important to note that in developing countries, consumers are often not aware of proper electronic waste handling procedures. They are also often unaware of the potentially harmful impacts improper electronic waste disposal can have on human health and the environment (Paes et al., 2017, p. 380, Waste Electrical section, para. 4). Second, new electronic devices have shorter lifespans than their older counterparts. These shortened life spans can be attributed to fast technological change and production systems that have made these products more affordable (Burns, Sayler, & Nietzel, 2019, p. 2, Background section, para. 2). Third, much of the electronic waste present in developing countries is imported from richer nations (Burns et al., 2019, p. 1, Background section, para. 1).  Richer nations  find exporting their electronic waste to lower-income countries attractive due to lower labor costs in the recycling process. It is estimated that of the electronic waste generated in richer nations, roughly 23 percent of that is exported to developing countries for handling (Seeberger et al., 2016, p. 8, Introduction section, para. 2).
