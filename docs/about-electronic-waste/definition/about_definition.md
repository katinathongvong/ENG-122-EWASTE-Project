Electronic devices or components that have either reached obsolescence or can no longer serve any favorable use are considered electronic waste (Paes, Bernardo, Lima, & Leal, 2017, p. 379, Waste Electrical section, para. 1-2). Examples of electronic waste include antiquated equipment once used to transfer information, disused consumer electronics, and office appliances (Seeberger et al., 2016, p. 8, Introduction section, para. 1). The world’s daily generation of electronic waste is estimated to be 40 million tons. Additionally, it is estimated that the generation of electronic waste accounts for 5 percent of the Earth’s generated waste (Paes et al., 2017, p. 378, Introduction section, para. 1). Furthermore, the composition of electronic waste is a mosaic of different materials, consisting of various  substances such as lead, flame retardants, and cadmium (Seeberger et al., 2016, p. 8, Introduction section, para. 3).
